<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I was born and raised in Haryana where I grew up  in Rohtak and always had good music playing around the house. 
  These threads of family, lawn tennis, and music have defined my life path and experiences. 
  I am currently pursuing a bachelor of technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of 
  Symbiosis Institute of technology in Pune with being a member on the SIU Lawn Tennis Team.
